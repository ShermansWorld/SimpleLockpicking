# SimpleLockping
## Version: 3.1 for 1.19.x
This is a simple plugin that allows players to lockpick chests, doors, trapdoors, and fence gates. Iron doors and Iron trapdoors have a 10% chance of opening for each attempt and everything else has a 20% chance. Chances can be changed in the config. Lockpicking also gives the player the ability to break into things that are normally locked/privated with plugins such as LockettePro.
